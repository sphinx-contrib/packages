`sphinxcontrib-packages` ðŸ“¦ Display a list of tools available on the host machine
=================================================================================

This `sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`__ extension provides some directives
to see what tools are available on the compiling machine. I wrote this because
I was developing a sphinx extension calling system commands, and I wanted to
be able to use is on `readthedocs <http://readthedocs.io>`__, but I did not
know which tools were available there
(and the `Dockerfile <https://hub.docker.com/r/readthedocs/build/~/dockerfile>`__ is not precise enough).

What's new?
-----------

See `changelog <https://git.framasoft.org/spalax/sphinxcontrib-packages/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>`_.
