Welcome to the `sphinxcontrib-packages` documentation
=====================================================

This `sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`__ extension provides some directives to
see what tools are available on the compiling machine. I wrote this because I was developing a sphinx extension calling system commands, and I wanted to be able to use is on `readthedocs <http://readthedocs.io>`__, but I did not know which tools were available there
(and the `Dockerfile <https://hub.docker.com/r/readthedocs/build/~/dockerfile>`__ is not precise enough).

.. warning::

    If your are reading this on `readthedocs <http://readthedocs.io>`__, keep in mind that those lists are not official. It is not guaranteed that those tools will remain available in the future: they only reflects what was available when this documentation was compiled.

    I do not know and I have nothing to do with the `readthedocs <http://readthedocs.io>`__ team, so I do not know how they choose what to install.
